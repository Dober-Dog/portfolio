            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I’m Logan Russsell, a passionate MERN Web Developer with a love for crafting innovative and user-centric web applications. With a solid foundation in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, I specialize in building dynamic and scalable solutions that not only meet but exceed user expectations.</p>
            <p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how technology can create meaningful experiences. This curiosity has evolved into a career where I blend technical skills with creativity to bring ideas to life. Whether I’m designing intuitive interfaces with React, developing robust APIs with Express, or managing data with MongoDB, I approach each project with dedication and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding, you might find me playing catch with my younger brothers-in-law, playing a good videogame, or helping my wife train our service dog. These activities not only enrich my life but also fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>I’m always excited to collaborate on new projects and connect with like-minded professionals. If you’re looking for a developer who combines technical expertise with a genuine passion for innovation, let’s get in touch!</p>
